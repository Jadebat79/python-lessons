# Number Analyzer
# ðŸŽ¯ Your Task
# Write a Python script that:

# Asks the user for a number n between 1 and 20.
    # If n is not within that range, print "Out of range" and exit.
# Otherwise, for each number from 1 to n:
    # Print whether the number is even or odd
    # Print its square

# After the loop, print:
    # The sum of all numbers from 1 to n
    # The average of the numbers
    # The product of the numbers
    # The count of even and odd numbers
