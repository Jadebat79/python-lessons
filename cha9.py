# Challenge: Port Range Analyzer
# ðŸŽ¯ Your Task
# Write a Python program that:

# 1. Asks the user how many ports they want to check (between 3 and 10).

# 2. Takes each port number as input and stores it in a list.

# 3. Uses functions to:
    # Count how many are well-known ports (0â€“1023)
    # Count how many are registered ports (1024â€“49151)
    # Count how many are dynamic/private ports (49152â€“65535)
    # Find the lowest and highest port entered
    # Calculate the average port number

# 4. Prints a neat summary.
